# Description #

The Master Api Key gem allows you to easily integrate API access restrictions into your services.
This gem will provide an API to create API Keys and revoke API access. 

##API Groups##

In addition, it provides basic authorization with controller groups. With controller groups,
you can separate your APIs into logical packages or products. 

For example, you can have an AdminController and UserController under the "users" group or
a MapsControllers, LocationsController, TrafficController under the "maps" group. 
This allows you to only give access to related controllers to a client easily.

# Using Master Api Key #
## Setup ##

First, include the gem into your project's GemFile

    $ gem 'master_api_key', ~> 1.0

Then, install and run the migrations

    $ rake master_api_key:install:migrations
    $ rake db:migrate
    
Next, add the following line to the seed file for integrating MasterApiKey seed data.
    ```ruby
          MasterApiKey::Engine.load_seed
    ``` 
    
Finally, setup the MasterApiKey Engine routes. 
* Go to the routes.rb file in your application
* Add the following line.
    ```ruby
      mount MasterApiKey::Engine => '/security'
    ``` 

You can replace the mounted path from 'security' to any sub path you'd like. In addition, running a db
migration should automatically generate a master_key APIKey for you.

## Managing the API Keys ##
 
###Generating an API key to Grant Access###
---
####Description####
This endpoint is for generating new API keys. Ensure that you keep track of who 
you've given access to the key. That way if you ever need to revoke the key, you'll
know who to contact to prevent outages for your clients. A master_key api token is 
required for all endpoints that add, delete, or modify the APIKeys. The key should have 
been generated by either seeding the db or running a db migration.

IMPORTANT: Do not reuse this api key for other controllers and no not share this key outside of trusted
users. This key will grant its users the ability to generate any api key they want, which is equivalent 
to giving them complete access to your API and control who accesses it.

####Endpoint####

    POST /security/api_key

####Headers####

| Header Param Name    | Required  | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | --------- | --------- |
| X-API-TOKEN      | yes | The api token of an APIKey in the master_key group. This is generated from seeding the db or a db migration |

    
####Parameters####

| Param Name    | Type        | Required  | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | --------- | --------- |
| group      | string | no | the name of a collection of controllers to grant access. Not providing a group will grant access to all public APIs |

####Responses####

| Response Code | Description |
| ------------- |------------ |
| 201           | Created     |
 
 _Example_     
```json
    {
        "apiKey":{
                    "id":1,
                    "api_token":"h7Uty6gPo5eYyA3VQPd-4w",
                    "group":"messaging"
                 },
        "status":"created"
    }
```
###Deleting an API Key by Record Id###

####Headers####

| Header Param Name    | Required  | Description  |

####Endpoint####

    DELETE /security/api_key/:id
    
####Parameters####

| Param Name    | Type        | Required  | Description  |

## Restricting Access to your APIs ##
### Clients using your APIs ###
When retricting access to your APIs, a new header field in your http request will be required.
The header key/value is:

    X-API-TOKEN: <api_token>

If the access token is within the api_keys table and has been authorized to access the controller,
then the user will be allowed to access you endpoint.

However, if the access token is not within the api_keys table then the user is considered not authenticated.

| Error Code | Http Code Name |
| ------------- |------------ |
| 401 | Unauthorized |

If the access token was authenticated but was not authorized to use the endpoint, then the following error code will be returned:

| Error Code | Http Code Name |
| ------------- |------------ |
| 403 | Forbidden |

### Integrating Master Api Key into your Controllers ###

The core module of this project is "MasterApiKey::ApiGatekeeper", which has the logic to validate the Api Tokens used to call the APIs.
The method to restrict access is by either adding a filter to the top of the controller or explicitly
calling the method to restrict access.

```ruby
#Restricting access by filters
before_action :authorize_action, only: [:create]

#Restricting access by explicitly calling method.
#If the call is authorized then the code block passed in will be executed.
def index
    authorize_action do
        head :ok
    end
end
```
If you want to override the default behavior when a request is considered 
not authenticated or unauthorized, you can override the following methods from ApiGateKeeper 
in your calling controller.

```ruby
    #Called when a request was not authenticated.
    def on_authentication_failure
      head(:unauthorized)
    end

    #Called when a request is not authorized
    def on_forbidden_request
      head(:forbidden)
    end
```

# Building the Gem #
Use the build gem script if you want a simple way to setup your workstation for development.
The script goes through several steps before verifting the build.
1. The RSpec unit and integration tests are run against master_api_key
2. The gem is built and installed in the current ruby environment

Once all tests are green, then it should be safe to push the gem to the repository. 

The basic usage for the build script is the following:

    $ ./build_gem.sh

During development you will need to update the gems, especially when you update the version file.
The option -u will update all gems including master_api_key

    $ ./build_gem.sh -u
    
For additional help use the -h option
 
# Testing #

To explicitly test this gem, you'll need to run the following command:

    $ rake test
