1.3.0 - Added Read/Write protection for controllers. Read: index/show, Write: create/destroy/new/edit
        Be mindful that running migrations will make all existing api keys read/write accessible.
        Additional logging for when users are forbidden from accessing an endpoint.
        Ensured all json responses are consistent and use snake case formatting.
1.2.0 - Added a method to include custom authorization methods beyond just API Groups.
        Switched dev environment from jruby to ruby since signing gems fails under that environment.
1.1.1 - Fixed a bug where the http code for creating ApiKeys was 200 instead of 201
1.1.0 - Added backwards compatibility to rails 3+
1.0.0 - Initial release. Has basic authentication and authorization 
        by API Keys with concept of API Groups as a means of authorizing authenticated users.
